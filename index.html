                            days from the date you receive your
                            judgment to file a notice of appeal,
                            so we recommend consulting with us

                            If we believe it is in your best interests,
                            we recommend settlement, mediation or arbitration
                            to reach equitable divorce terms.

                            Between myself, the case managers, and the attorneys,
                            we were compatible and in sync from day one.
                            I really appreciated that they met with me one-on-one.
                            They accommodated me by meeting half way since
                            I didn’t live close to their office.
                            Whenever issues arose, I called and my case managers
                            were easy to reach. They always answered my questions.
                            I am very pleased with the service I received from Inga Oganezova.
                            I would recommend her to my family and friends whenever they need professional representation.
                            My friend had a different issue and I told him to call Inga.”

                                I was very grateful when Ms. Oganezova was able to personally take the time
                                to speak with me and agreed to take my case.
                                I was very satisfied with results Ms. Oganezova achieved for my case and the entire staff at Sardaryan Brothers.”

                                From the time Inga picks up the phone, she makes the
                                process super efficient and simple. She asks you to
                                fill out a short form which later goes in front of the
                                lawyer and the lawyer will review the details of your
                                case before you even walking through the door. The
                                consultation was efficient, informative and straight-forward.
                                Ms. Oganezova put my mind at ease and by the time I left,
                                I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I
                                knew what strategy to use for my family law case.
